# Smart Hospital Management System

## Problem Statement
In the current era of technology, there is a pressing need for the implementation of a hassle-free Hospital Management System (HMS) to fulfill the requirements of multi-specialty hospitals. The existing manual method is ineffective, time-consuming, vulnerable to mistakes, lacks sufficient departmental integration, resulting in delays in patient treatment, misunderstandings, and general inefficiency in hospital operations. Therefore, it is necessary to effectuate an HMS to mitigate all these discrepancies and bring about several other benefits too.

## Abstract
The Smart Hospital Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and enhance the management of healthcare facilities. Developed using PHP and MySQL, this project aims to efficiently organize and manage various aspects of hospital operations. The system includes modules for administration, doctor, patient, nurse, accountant, and pharmacist, providing a user-friendly interface for each role. Key features encompass streamlined patient management, prescription records, user-friendly profiles, payment history access, comprehensive report management, blood bank inventory, customizable settings, and notice management.
